        <h2>What Is A Mantis Shrimp?</h2>
        <p> Mantis Shrimp are sea crustaceans that are incredibly impressive. The Mantis shrimp has a lifespan of 3-6 years, and averages a length of 10 centimeters but some can even reach lengths of 38 centimeters! The mantis shrimp can be recognized by its gorgeous outer shell, and their calcified clubs. Those clubs are normally used to kill their prey or open hard shells, but how strong are they? One punch from those powerful clubs has the same acceleration as a <b>.22 caliber rifle.</b> It is so fast and strong it is capable of producing bubbles and <strong><em>boils</em></strong> water around them. And they are so used to their power, their clubs contain some special shock-absorbent core that stops them from breaking. <br> Regardless of their beauty, mantis shrimp are also known to be pretty aggressive and territorial towards intruders.<br><img src="images2/download.jpg" alt="mantis shrimp body" width="200" height="136" class="flowRight"></p>

			<h3>Facts</h3>
			<p>Their beauty isn't the only thing that is impressive about them, they also are capable of astonishing things. To ease you in, how many color receptors do you have? humans typically have three, green, blue, and red. Dogs have two. Butterflies have <em>five</em>, green, blue, red and two more that we can't see. But what about mantis shrimp? How many do <i>they</i> have? well, mantis shrimp don't have two. Or three. Not even five. But rather <strong>SIXTEEN</strong> color receptors. That means that in places where we see complete darkness they would see an atomic bomb of color!</p>

            <blockquote> <h3>A Little More About Mantis Shrimp</h3>
            <ul> <li>They are neither mantis' <em>nor</em> Shrimp, but rather they are 450 different types of species belonging to the order <i>Stomatopa</i>.</li>
                <li>They have two eyes that sit upon stalks that move independently from one another.</li>
                <li>The mantis shrimp are recognized to have some of the most impressive and complex eyes in the entire animal kingdom. So much so, they can see see a huge range of wavelengths. They also use these eyes to communicate with one another (through the use of reflecting light).</li>
                <li>One of their punches produces 1,500 Newtons of force, can reach temperatures of several thousand <b>kelvins</b> and their bubbles can collapse into light.</li>
                <li>Mantis shrimp are also insanely smart.</li></ul>

		<h2>Where Did They Come From?</h2>
		<p>Mantis Shrimp can be found in the warm waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, mostly along the crevices of coral and rocks that rest on the ocean floor. Their species can be traced all the way back to <strong>before</strong> the dinosaurs, and believe that their species began evolving independently from other members of the class of <i>Malacostraca</i> nearly 400 million years ago (that's about 170 million years before dinosaurs)</p>

			<h3>Why can't I see them?</h3>
			<p>Aquariums tend to not often carry mantis shrimp because they would slaughter anything they came in contact with, which isn't always something you'd want to see. And not only that, but aquarium tanks wouldn't be able to hold them in, unless they had almost two or so layers of <em>bulletproof glass</em>, and even then, they would still "attack" the glass.
